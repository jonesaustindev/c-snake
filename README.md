# Snake

I've been wanting to try out writing something in C, so what better way to get a small intro than to implement a classic game with [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)!

-----

### Running the game

Right now the `Makefile` is pretty specifically setup with having `Raylib` at version `5.0` installed with homebrew (`brew install raylib`). You can update the linking and includes paths if you install `Raylib` at a different location.
